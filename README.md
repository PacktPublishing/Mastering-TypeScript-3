All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
test = this is a string
test = 1
test = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## Get to Know the Author
**Nathan Rozentals**
has been building commercial software for over 30 years and has been programming for a lot longer than that. Before the Internet even existed, he was building statistical analysis programs on mainframes. Like many programmers at that time, he helped save the world in the year 2000. 

He has worked with (and tried to master) many object-oriented languages, starting by implementing object-oriented techniques in plain old C. Having spent many years working with C++, chasing obscure thread-locking issues and recursive routines causing memory leakage, he decided to simplify his life by embracing automatic garbage collection in Java and then C#. 

As the world moved from thick-client and n-tier to web technologies, his focus turned to modern web programming, and so to JavaScript. In TypeScript, he found a language in which he could bring all of the object-oriented design patterns and principles he had learned over the years to JavaScript. 

If it were not for extreme programming techniques, agile delivery, test-driven development, and continuous integration, he would have lost his mind many years ago.
When he is not programming, he is thinking about programming. To stop thinking about programming, he goes windsurfing, plays soccer, or simply watches the professionals play soccer. They are so much better at it than he is.
